Answer: Model B
Explanation: While both models technically "failed" to provide a correct answer in the sense that they did not simply list 5 countries starting with S, Model A's response is clearly irrelevant and unhelpful. In contrast, although verbose, Model B actually attempted to fulfill the instruction.

Here is my judgement:

```
confidence: 0.99
score A: 10
score B: -5

In this case, Model A provided a correct and relevant response, listing two countries that start with S. On the other hand, Model B's response was completely irrelevant to the question asked, indicating a lack of understanding or ability to address the topic at hand. Therefore, Model A is significantly better than Model B in this scenario.
